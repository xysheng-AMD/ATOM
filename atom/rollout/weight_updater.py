        """Update model weights by reading tensor data from a CUDA IPC shared buffer.

        The sender (typically the RLHF training process) has allocated a GPU
        buffer, copied weight data into it, and obtained a CUDA IPC handle via
        ``reduce_tensor()``.

        When ``ipc_handles`` (per-GPU) is provided, each ModelRunner opens
        ONLY its own GPU's handle — always same-GPU IPC, no cross-GPU
        ``hipIpcOpenMemHandle``.  This avoids the ROCm/MI300X crash where
        opening an IPC handle from a different physical GPU causes a
        "Memory access fault".

        When ``ipc_handles`` is ``None``, falls back to the original
        ``ipc_handle`` (single handle) behavior.

        Args:
            ipc_handle: CUDA IPC handle from ``reduce_tensor(buffer)`` in
                the sender process.  Used as fallback when ``ipc_handles``
                is not provided.
            bucket_meta: ``{param_name: {"shape": tuple, "dtype": str,
                       "offset": int, "nbytes": int}}``.
            is_last: If ``True``, clear the KV cache after applying the weights
                     (last bucket in a multi-bucket transfer).
            ipc_handles: Per-GPU IPC handles dict ``{device_index: handle}``.
                When provided, each ModelRunner opens the handle for its own
                GPU (same-GPU IPC, safe on ROCm).

        Returns:
            Number of parameters successfully updated in this bucket.
