"""`Config.sleep_keeps_memory_resident`: who keeps their memory, and when.

Sleep frees the weights and the KV pool and wake recaptures the decode graphs.
That recapture faults under `expandable_segments`, so there is an option to
keep both allocated and skip it -- and the whole point of the option is that
nothing moves, which a test on `updated`/`released` counters cannot see. These
assert on `data_ptr()` and on object identity.

The option is off by default because keeping them costs exactly the memory a
colocated trainer sleeps the rollout engine to reclaim.
